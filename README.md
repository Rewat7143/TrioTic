# Tic Tac Toe Game Design

## Overview

The Tic Tac Toe game is a classic two-player strategy game played on a 3x3 grid. The objective is to place three of your symbols (X or O) in a row, column, or diagonal.

## Game Rules

1. **Board Layout:** 
   - A 3x3 grid where players place their symbols alternately.

2. **Player Turns:**
   - Players take turns to place their symbol ('X' or 'O') on an empty cell.
   
3. **Winning Condition:**
   - A player wins if they have three of their symbols in a row, column, or diagonal.
   
4. **Draw Condition:**
   - If the entire grid is filled without any player achieving three symbols in a row, the game ends in a draw.

## Game Flow

1. **Start:**
   - The game starts with an empty grid.

2. **Player Input:**
   - Players input their move by choosing an available cell.

3. **Validation:**
   - Validate the move for correctness and check for win or draw conditions after each turn.

4. **End Game:**
   - Declare the winner or a draw when the game reaches a conclusion.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** Standard libraries for basic functionality, potentially tkinter for GUI.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run the main Python file to start the game.

## Future Improvements
